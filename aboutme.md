My name is Soomin Cho. I define myself with these qualities:

- Hardworking
- Responsible
- Proactive
- Motivational

### My story

I am interested in explore qualities that make us human and find out whether it is possible to transfer how human minds and the brain work to robots and computers. I had been wondering if someday robots could have emotions and show creativity.

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
