A Thousand Blues is a sci fi written by a Korean author, Cheon Seon-Ran. It talks about the relationship between a jockey robot named “Collie”, and a racehorse, “Today” that will be euthanized. The only goal of Collie is to prevent Today from enthanization by making him participate in one more race to prove that it is worth keeping Today alive.

Working in the Human Factors Psychology lab, I was getting interested in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). The possibility of transferring human traits to non-human objects such as computers and robots was fascinating. Before reading this book, I was not familiar with how complex it would be if robots could think and feel emotions as people do. 

Collie is the jockey robot that can think and feel emotions because an engineer added human cognitive skills by accident. The other jockey robots were invented only for the sake of a light weight, compared to human counterparts, so that audience can enjoy more fun and excitement by watching horses running much faster. On the contrary, Collie obtained emotions and empathy, so he understood Today’s condition based on its breathing and body warmth and used them as cues to encourage Today. Although whipping made Today go faster, which was what other jokey robots frequently did to their horses, Collie knew that Today was not happy. Besides whipping, Collie also communicated with Today by patting it, which made Today happy, stable, and even run faster than using a whip. Such communication made them a better and competitive team than any other team. Collie listened to Today’s heart beating and feels whenever it is excited or exhausted.

The book also taught me the beauty of humanity. People are not perfect. We make mistakes and make wrong decisions. During the story, broken parts of Collie were replaced with heavier elements to fix him. When the race that could be Today’s last race just started, at the end of the story, Collie noticed how excited Today was for the race and its desire to run faster. Collie also noticed that his heavier elements were burdening Today and preventing it from running as fast as Today wanted. Collie could have ignored those signals. However, he cared about Today so much, and he chose to sacrifice himself by falling off from Today. In the eye of other jockey robots, falling off from a horse was a horrible mistake. However, for Collie, it was not a mistake but was the opportunity to achieve his one and only goal, saving Today. Likewise, People sometimes sacrifice themselves for their loved ones. Nevertheless, it would be that sacrifice that keeps humanity. Collie’s only wish was to keep Today alive, which was achieved by the mistake. Today’s only wish was to continue to run, which could have never happened without the mistake. People cannot be robots that always calculate the exact answers without errors. It would be imperfection that completes humans and that allows all the joy, sadness, anger, and colorful lives.
